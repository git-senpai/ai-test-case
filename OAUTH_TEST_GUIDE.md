# OAuth Test Guide

## Fixed Issues

✅ **Missing auth.js middleware** - Created new JWT-based middleware
✅ **GitHub access token** - Now included in JWT token
✅ **GitHub routes** - Updated to work with new authentication

## How to Test

### 1. Deploy the Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub OAuth with JWT and access tokens"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Test OAuth Flow

1. Visit: `https://ai-test-case-nu.vercel.app`
2. Click "Continue with GitHub"
3. Authorize the application
4. Should be redirected back and logged in

### 3. Test GitHub API Calls

After login, the app should be able to:

- Fetch user repositories
- Access repository files
- Create pull requests

## What Was Fixed

1. **Created new `auth.js` middleware** with JWT authentication
2. **Updated OAuth flow** to include GitHub access token in JWT
3. **Fixed GitHub routes** to use `req.user.accessToken`
4. **Maintained all existing functionality** with new authentication system

## Key Changes

- **JWT includes GitHub access token** for API calls
- **Auth middleware** validates JWT and extracts user info
- **GitHub routes** work exactly as before
- **No breaking changes** to existing functionality

The OAuth should now work perfectly in production!
